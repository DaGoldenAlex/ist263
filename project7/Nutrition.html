                    <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p>Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Include lean sources of protein such as chicken, fish, tofu, and beans in your diet. These foods provide amino acids that aid in building and repairing tissues. Additionally, protein helps to support a healthy immune system and can contribute to weight management by promoting a feeling of fullness.</p>

        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates provide energy for your workouts. Opt for complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. These foods release energy gradually, providing a sustained fuel source for physical activities. Carbohydrates also play a role in supporting brain function and can enhance exercise performance. Including a variety of carbohydrates in your diet ensures a well-rounded source of nutrients for overall health and fitness.</p>

        <div class="exercise-card">
        <h2>Caffeine</h2>
        <p>Caffeine can enhance alertness and performance. Consume it in moderation through sources like coffee, tea, or pre-workout supplements. Caffeine acts as a stimulant that can improve mental focus and reduce the perception of effort during exercise. It may also boost metabolism and aid in fat burning. However, it's important to be mindful of individual tolerance levels and avoid excessive consumption to prevent negative side effects such as jitteriness and disrupted sleep.</p>

    <section id="fats">
        <div class="exercise-card">
        <h2>Fats</h2>
        <p>Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil, are important for overall health and can support energy needs. These fats provide essential fatty acids that the body cannot produce on its own. They play a key role in supporting cell structure, hormone production, and nutrient absorption. Including a moderate amount of healthy fats in your diet can contribute to cardiovascular health, help regulate cholesterol levels, and provide a sense of satiety, promoting a balanced and sustainable eating pattern.</p>

    <section id="sugar">

        <h2>Sugar</h2>
        <p>Limit added sugars in your diet. Choose natural sources of sweetness like fruits and be mindful of processed foods with high sugar content. Excessive sugar intake is linked to various health issues, including weight gain, inflammation, and increased risk of chronic diseases. Opting for whole foods and reducing the consumption of sugary beverages and snacks can help maintain stable blood sugar levels and support overall well-being. Paying attention to food labels and choosing alternatives with lower added sugar content contributes to a healthier lifestyle.</p>

    <section id="sodium">
        <div class="exercise-card">
        <h2>Sodium</h2>
        <p>Manage sodium intake by avoiding excessively salty foods. Opt for fresh ingredients and use herbs and spices for flavor. High sodium intake is associated with increased blood pressure and cardiovascular risks. Choosing whole, minimally processed foods and reducing the use of added salt in cooking can contribute to a heart-healthy diet. Be mindful of hidden sources of sodium in packaged foods, and consider flavoring meals with herbs, garlic, and other seasonings to enhance taste without compromising health. Prioritizing a balanced and low-sodium diet supports overall cardiovascular wellness.</p>

These nutrient-dense foods provide essential vitamins and minerals that support various bodily functions. Antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables help combat oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and support a strong immune system.
