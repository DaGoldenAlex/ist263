            Current Major: Information and Management of Technology
           
            My interests working with this major is that I want to learn how to develop applications that could tie in with fitness and health.
            
            A list of accomplishments:
            
           - I have taken Python and Haskell, so I have a bit of coding experience. 
            
           - There are still more accomplishments I have yet to achieve, but I am looking forward to joining at least 2 organizations on campus that could help me learn several skills and connections along the way. 
           
           Outside of work in school I like to exercise I will be at the Barnes center a lot, my favorite show to watch is One Piece it has plenty of episodes but it's worth the journey to watch, 
           I prefer a chill and peaceful spot to be at like seating on a tree, I could get real competitive in some sports and games if you play ping pong, badminton, or tennis I will give you a challenge.
